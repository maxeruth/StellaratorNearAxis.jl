# StellaratorNearAxis.jl
This is a package that computes the stellarator near-axis expansion to high order. It will be in flux over the next few weeks (Updated 11/18/2024). On the to-do list are:
1. Include a couple example notebooks.
2. Add GitHub actions, particularly for Documentation.

On the longer-term to-do list are:
1. Implementation of more metrics (such as quasisymmetry)
2. Incorporation of other solvers besides direct vacuum near-axis
3. Addition of AD tools for optimization
4. Hooks to Simsopt and/or StellaratorOptimization.jl
5. Creation of a couple quality-of-life macros for automatically checking series operations
6. Create unit tests.

If you would like to use this package in your research and would particularly like one of these features, contact me at `maximilian.ruth@austin.utexas.edu`. I'm happy to collaborate!
